</a>


  <div class="content">
    <p>Let&rsquo;s face it: most of the companies out there (including most of the ones I worked for)
hire opportunistically. They wait until they have a specific need, then quickly put together a
job description, and publish the opening in the various channels that are readily accessible,
hoping that they get a fit. Most of the time they can&rsquo;t find what they are looking for in
a reasonable amount of time, and for the right salary. There&rsquo;s four options available at that
point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hire someone who is available now, but not as strong a fit as you would like, and hope to grow
them into the role later (i.e. compromise on the required skill set).</li>
<li>Hire someone very senior who has the right skill set (often exceeds the right skill set), but is
significantly more expensive (i.e. compromise on the salary).</li>
<li>Hire a contractor as a temporary solution, while you are still looking for that ideal candidate
(once again compromising on the financial side).</li>
<li>Abandon the role completely, and find some other way of dealing with the requirements (either
by outsourcing the corresponding work, or distributing it among various existing team members
that individually have parts of the required skills).</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that all of these options are sub-optimal by quite a margin. If push comes to shove,
I would prefer hiring someone without the complete skill set and growing him/her, or if there is
room to throw money at the problem, hire a contractor. Nonetheless, these are not good options
either; they are simply the best of what&rsquo;s left. The ideal scenario would be to never find yourself
in this situation in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that in addition to the mismatches mentioned above, there are also a couple of
second order effects, both of which strongly impact culture. To begin with, cultural fit is a
very tempting target to compromise on. When a company is faced with the choice between someone
who is a strong cultural fit, but is missing part of the skill set, and someone who has more of
the required skills but is not a good cultural fit, they will often opt for the second. This is
hardly surprising once you realize that opportunistic hiring is often a reaction to a missing
skill set (or missing capacity in a skill set, even if the skill set exists). The second effect
is caused by the time delay in hiring: unless the company got lucky and found exactly what they
were looking for, they are probably already behind the deadline dictated by the needs by the time
they hire someone (sub-optimal as the fit may be). This means that there is
little time for on-boarding, which is one of the few methods by which you can avoid cultural
dilution. As a result, culture takes a double hit.</p>

<p>So, how does one prevent this situation in the first place? In my opinion, the answer lies in
creating and executing a long-term strategy that organizes the process better. This strategy
should address all the relevant challenges into a coherent approach, that can then be planned
and executed. Note that the original opportunistic approach is often referred to as the &ldquo;Spray
and Pray&rdquo; strategy in recruiting circles, but as it does not have an organized way of addressing
the major challenges, it does not fit our definition of a hiring strategy.</p>

<p>The first challenge to tackle is predicting the need. If you go back a couple of paragraphs,
you will notice that a significant portion of the problem is simply that, in opportunistic hiring,
the company is simply reacting to an existing need. But there is rarely a good reason why a
need would develop unexpectedly. Generally, it should be possible to look at the other
strategies of the company (primarily the sales, product, and service strategies), and forecast
the hiring needs quite accurately. With this forecast at hand, the company can plan the hiring, and
begin the process with sufficient time before the need develops, to be able to fulfill the position
at about the right time. Getting this right means that you need to develop a <em>quantitative</em>
idea of how long it takes to fulfill which kinds of positions. This implies that you instrument
the hiring process to measure the relevant KPIs, and an understanding of how to use them.</p>

<p>The second challenge to address is develop a clear idea of what kind of people you need. This
will once again depend on what kind of department strategies the company is trying to execute,
as part of the overall business strategy. For example, if all of your software needs are simple,
for internal use only, and not mission critical, then it might not make financial sense to hire
top talent at premium prices. On the other hand, if you are offering primarily a technical
consulting service, where the engineers are your biggest assets, are directly billable at
high rates, and are the main driver of success for your customers, then you want the very best
people you can get, and are willing to pay a significant premium for them. If the cost of
failures is high, you probably need to target very experienced people - in general they know
more of the ways in which one could get in trouble, and are, therefore, better at avoiding them.
At the same time, they tend to be more expensive, less flexible, and less willing to take risks.
On the other hand, if the cost of failure is fairly low and the desire for experimentation
fairly high, you may want to hire younger, less experienced people. They tend to be more
willing to take risks, but will make mistakes more frequently. As a side-benefit, they are usually
cheaper. Note that most companies will have different groups with different needs, so they will
be executing multiple strategies at the same time. It is also very important to be honest about
what you really need and what you are really implementing as a strategy. I have seen many
companies that say they want &ldquo;younger&rdquo; people, but in reality they criterion they look at most
is salary expectations. Incidentally, age is a protected category in quite a few countries, and
making hiring decisions on the basis of age is actually a violation of the law.</p>

<p>The third challenge is keeping the demands realistic. Job requirements are combinatoric filters:
every time you add a requirement to a job description, the size of the pool of available
candidates goes down by a large factor. In Switzerland I saw multiple postings which, along
with all the other requirements, also demanded business fluency in German, Italian, French, and
English. While the first three are official languages, in reality the majority of people
are business fluent in one, and have some knowledge of another. There is a small percentage
that is business fluent in two, and an infinitesimally small number that is business fluent in
all three. The demand for so called &ldquo;Jesus profiles&rdquo; is especially common in leadership positions.
Often, candidates are asked for a lifetime of domain expertise (e.g. 20 years in insurance),
extensive experience in managing and mentoring people, specific experience in specific
technologies, pre-sales or sales experience, experience with large multinationals, strategy
experience, significant P&amp;L responsibility, significant exposure to clients, willingness to
travel up to 60%, and so on (this is based on a real posting). The problem is that, even if
you could find one or two of the very few individuals that meet that criteria, they will
most likely already have jobs. And even if you find one that is willing to leave, you will
have to compete with an entire industry to get him/her. And doing so will be very expensive.
First of all, separate your  requirements into must-haves and nice to have. If you don&rsquo;t and
you have a list of 10 or more requirements, your implicit strategy is that people will ignore
the fact that they don&rsquo;t meet some of them, and apply anyway. The problem with this is that
what gets ignored gets picked by the candidate, not by you. It is much simpler to compromise
on some of the requirements that are either not essential, or you can teach once the person is
hired. My favorite target is domain expertise: if you are hiring <em>a back-end engineer</em> for an
e-commerce business, do you really need them to know (before they come to you) the intricacies
of on-line retail? My guess is that the knowledge is useful but incidental, and that the
company is brimming with people that have that knowledge and could teach the new hires.
Also, think long and hard about
what you consider a must-have: it should be reserved for the kind of requirement that, if you
can&rsquo;t find, <em>you will give up on trying to hire for that role!</em>
In general, if your job description has more than 5 must-haves, you are going to have a
hard-time finding someone. You should have a plan for how to address this. Either you should
be willing to pay your way to overcoming competition and resistance, or you should be willing
to spend a <em>lot</em> of time to fill the position. And since finding the candidates will be
a big part of the challenge, consider hiring recruiters or an executive search firm.</p>

<p>The fourth challenge should be developing your channels. There is a remarkable number of
companies that simply post job openings on the company web-page, LinkedIn, and the major
job boards, and hope that candidates will simply flock to their door. Do you actually
keep track of which channels are effective for which positions? Note that this interacts
strongly with the type of people you are trying to find, so the strategy should have
coherent approaches for these two challenges. For example, if you are looking for
medical professionals, your generic local job board is probably not your best option. If
you are looking for experienced professionals, I would advise against focusing on job fairs.
A special note on the company web-site: unless you have an unusually strong employer brand
(think Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), your company web-page is not enough. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
how attractive <em>you</em> think you are as a company; all that matters is  how attractive
<em>the candidate</em> thinks you are. Most candidates will consider searching your company web site
as doubling their effort for minimal return, unless they are so interested working for you
that they are unwilling to risk missing a post. For the hard-to-find specializations
(e.g., aviation machinist), you should certainly consider creating a candidate pool that
you can tap into by engaging people as the opportunity arises, and getting them to agree
to be in such a pool. And as mentioned before, for the really hard leadership profiles I
would consider retaining and executive search firm. They invest in maintaining a pool of
desirable candidates that they can tap into on your behalf. Conversely, for profiles that
are fairly common (e.g., gastronomy, retail, etc.), the complexity of maintaining a
talent pool hardly seems to be worth it. In short, the more specialized the profile, the
more you should invest in refining and developing the channels for finding candidates.</p>

<p>The fifth challenge should be dealing with the competition. Unless your hiring strategy
is OK with the average candidate, you should keep in mind that the candidates you like
are the candidates that everyone else is going to like as well. First of all, figure out
how to get their attention enough to get them to apply. Also reduce all friction in the
process. I find it incredible that there are so many companies out there that use all of
these optimization concepts day in and day out to increase sales, but forget that the same
optimizations apply to hiring. Think about what makes you uniquely interesting to the kind
of candidates you are looking for. Once again, the approach here must be coherent with
the type of people you are looking for. If you are looking for young, adventurous innovators
it does not make sense to be pitching your retirement benefits. And vice-versa - if you are
looking for seasoned professionals, focusing on the ping-pong tables on the third floor is
probably not going to yield results. Think about developing an employer brand to help you
stand out from the noise. And above all, think about how you are going to close the deal
once you have found the right candidate, realizing that they will almost certainly have
other offers to consider at the same time. What levers are you planning to use to compete:
compensation, work-environment, interesting work, flexibility, benefits, career opportunities,
or something else entirely (e.g., a non-profit competing by benefiting a cause)? There are
a lot of companies that simply do not address the challenge at all; in the end they end up
hiring the people that simply did not have any other options. I still recall a
discussion on turnover with an HR person in a company I worked for, which ended with them
saying: &ldquo;What are they going to do? We&rsquo;re the only company hiring English-speakers in this
area!&rdquo; At least it&rsquo;s a competitive strategy, even if I find it disagreeable.</p>

<p>There is many other challenges to tackle, not the least of which are cultural fit, and retainment,
but I think there is little value in listing all of them. The important thing to remember
is that many of these challenges interact with each other, so the approaches for each have to
be coherent with each other. Unfortunately, there are a large number of companies (usually
SMEs) that have no discernible hiring strategy, so there are no synergies between approaches.
Even worse, sometimes the approaches work against each other. Of the companies that have a
strategy, a surprising portion of them do not have coherent strategies because some of the
challenges are tackled by HR, and others by the business line leaders, with no coordination.
At the end of the day, the majority of the companies I know seem to be struggling with some
part of hiring or another. And above all, avoid having to hire reactively at all costs!</p>
