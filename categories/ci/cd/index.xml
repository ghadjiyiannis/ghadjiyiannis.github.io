      <description>Building CI/CD pipelines seems to be one of those topics that every team seems to struggle with. There are many effects that contribute to this:
 CI pipelines are almost always legacy infrastructure, built at a time when both the software and the team were fundamentally smaller and simpler. Being tooling infrastructure, they are never a priority. As a result they are never maintained or adjusted to new needs. For the same reason (not a priority), people almost never invest any significant amount of design in them.</description>
