      <description>I am not sure why, but out of the set of all anti-patterns, drive-by coding is the one I am personally most disturbed by. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so unnecessary. Perhaps because it&amp;rsquo;s indicative of laziness on behalf of the developer. Perhaps because it is, itself, a smell of much more serious cultural issues. For exactly this last reason, if not for any other, I feel very strongly that this particular anti-pattern should be uprooted mercilessly whenever noticed, before it becomes endemic and destroys both the health of the code-base, as well as the culture of the team.</description>
