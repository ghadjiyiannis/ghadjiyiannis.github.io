      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: most of the companies out there (including most of the ones I worked for) hire opportunistically. They wait until they have a specific need, then quickly put together a job description, and publish the opening in the various channels that are readily accessible, hoping that they get a fit. Most of the time they can&amp;rsquo;t find what they are looking for in a reasonable amount of time, and for the right salary.</description>

      <description>A long time ago, I was in Barcelona attending an API workshop with our teams there. On the second day of the workshop, the discussion got a bit sidetracked, but it was one of those sidetracks that leads to insights that are more valuable than the main theme of the workshop. I remember the group CTO at the time declaring &amp;ldquo;Developers write code, Software Engineers solve problems!&amp;rdquo;. For some reason it struck me as such a profound statement, that I still remember it to this day as the main idea of value I got that day.</description>
