      <description>Customer centricity is another one of those points that is constantly talked about but often rarely actually reasoned about. As a result, most of the discussion out there is usually trivial and essentially consists of the equivalent of &amp;ldquo;Go ask what the customer wants, then go build it&amp;rdquo;. I would respectfully offer the opinion that that is not customer centricity, but rather, customer servitude! There are three fundamental mistakes in the idea of &amp;ldquo;Go ask what the customer wants, then go build it&amp;rdquo;, and I want to examine all of them critically to dispel the trivial hype around the topic.</description>
